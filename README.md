# BC_Macro_Refugia

This repository presents an analysis that generates a macro refugia
layering using BEC 1970 and BEC 2080 identifying equivalent areas.

### Data

The macro refugia analysis current and 2080 modelled BEC were used -
from: Wang, Tongli, Elizabeth M. Campbell, Gregory A. O’Neill, and Sally
N. Aitken. 2012. “Projecting Future Distributions of Ecosystem Climate
Niches: Uncertainties and Management Applications.” Forest Ecology and
Management 279 (September): 128–40.
<https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2012.05.034>.
(<https://cfcg.forestry.ubc.ca/projects/climate-data/climatebcwna/>)

### Usage

There are four core scripts that are required for the analysis, a
run_all.R script is used to control their execution:

-   01_clean.R
-   02_analysis.R
-   03_visualize.R
-   04_output.R

### Project Status

This project is part of a Provincial conservation assessment being led
by the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy. The analysis
is exploratory and will be added to and updated over the coming months.
